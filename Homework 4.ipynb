The adjusted R^2 lowers down to 0.726 so that means after penalizing for extra predictors, our starts fitting a little less correctly so there may be factors that aren't really significant. Our F-Statistic is 6.665 which is not too high but because our p value is 0.007 our model is statistically significant. Now to make sure our model assumptions are met we look at the diagnostics. First is omnibus and beacsue our p value is 0.570 we are in a normal range. Our durbin watson is 1.54 which is acceptable. Our Con No. is 1.00 so this is excellent.\n","a)My final conclusion is that factor b and c significantly affect tool life because of their low p value. Factor b has p value of 0.009 and a coefficient of 42 which is very high. Even at a 99% confidence level we can say that this factor is statistically significant. Factor c is also very significant with a coefficient of 35 and a p value of 0.02, at a confidence level of .98 we can conclude that this factor is statistically significant. We cannot say the saem baout factor a, because it has little to no correlation with tool life.\n","b) The pattern I am observing is that once factors start being intercepted or both being incorporated then it actually decreases the coefficient and it ends up being negative. This means the intersecitons decrease tool life. Factors a an c combined most strongly decrease tool life. I cannot conclude any of the combination of factors produces a longer tool life than individual factors themselves.\n","c)I would say the best combination of cutting speed and cutting angle that always gives good results regardless of metal hardness is when cutting speed is at a high and cutting angle is at a high, it doesn't really matter the hardness of the metal because ac is our highest and most positive correlation."],"metadata":{"id":"dafwgnpYVJtO"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#13.6\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","import statsmodels.api as sm\n","from statsmodels.formula.api import ols\n","\n","\n","df = pd.read_csv('/content/SQC_HW_data2.csv')\n","\n","rep1 = df.copy()\n","rep1['Y'] = df['Response1']\n","\n","rep2 = df.copy()\n","rep2['Y'] = df['Response2']\n","\n","df_long = pd.concat([rep1, rep2], ignore_index=True)\n","\n","\n","model = ols('Y ~ A + B + C + D + A:B + A:C + A:D + B:C + B:D + C:D + \\\n","            A:B:C + A:B:D + A:C:D + B:C:D + A:B:C:D', data=df_long).fit()\n","\n","\n","aov_table = sm.stats.anova_lm(model, typ=2)\n","print(\"\\n===== ANOVA Table =====\")\n","print(aov_table)\n","\n","\n","print(\"\\n===== Model Summary =====\")\n","print(model.summary())\n"],"metadata":{"id":"y5F6RKSW211V","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760508695179,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":143,"user":{"displayName":"Katherine Flores","userId":"10894472277515403164"}},"outputId":"9432ffe2-7754-4541-fd5b-aaff303d8791"},"execution_count":42,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","===== ANOVA Table =====\n","             sum_sq    df          F    PR(>F)\n","A         657.03125   1.0  22.729730  0.000210\n","B          13.78125   1.0   0.476757  0.499790\n","C          57.78125   1.0   1.998919  0.176574\n","D         124.03125   1.0   4.290811  0.054847\n","A:B       132.03125   1.0   4.567568  0.048369\n","A:C         3.78125   1.0   0.130811  0.722325\n","A:D        38.28125   1.0   1.324324  0.266726\n","B:C         2.53125   1.0   0.087568  0.771099\n","B:D         0.28125   1.0   0.009730  0.922650\n","C:D        22.78125   1.0   0.788108  0.387824\n","A:B:C     215.28125   1.0   7.447568  0.014861\n","A:B:D     175.78125   1.0   6.081081  0.025348\n","A:C:D       7.03125   1.0   0.243243  0.628574\n","B:C:D       7.03125   1.0   0.243243  0.628574\n","A:B:C:D    47.53125   1.0   1.644324  0.218001\n","Residual  462.50000  16.0        NaN       NaN\n","\n","===== Model Summary =====\n","                            OLS Regression Results                            \n","==============================================================================\n","Dep.
